# üåç Introduction
Next location prediction plays a crucial role in various real-world applications. Recently, due to the limitation of existing deep learning methods, attempts have been made to apply large language models (LLMs) to zero-shot next location prediction task. However, they directly generate the final output using LLMs without systematic design, which limits the potential of LLMs to uncover complex mobility patterns and underestimates their extensive reserve of global geospatial knowledge. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{AgentMove}, a systematic agentic prediction framework to achieve generalized next location prediction. 
In AgentMove, we first decompose the mobility prediction task and design specific modules to complete them, including spatial-temporal memory for individual mobility pattern mining, world knowledge generator for modeling the effects of urban structure and collective knowledge extractor for capturing the shared patterns among population. Finally, we combine the results of three modules and conduct a reasoning step to generate the final predictions. 
Extensive experiments utilizing mobility data from two distinct sources reveal that AgentMove surpasses the leading baseline by 3.33\% to 8.57\% across 8 out of 12 metrics and it shows robust predictions with various LLMs as base and also less geographical bias across cities.

# üí° Running Experiments


## LLM API Key
Configure the relevant API Key in `.bashrc`, then execute `source .bashrc`
```bash
# provide free tokons for many 7B models
export SiliconFlow_API_KEY="xx"

# following APIs may need proxy
export DeepInfra_API_KEY="xx"
export OpenAI_API_KEY="xx"

# you can also deploy model locally via vllm
export vllm_KEY="xx"

# set nominatim server address if you deploy it locally
export nominatim_deploy_server_address="IP:Port"
```
We define supported models list in `models/llm_api.py`, you can add new models and new platforms by modifying it.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/AgentMove.git

cd AgentMove

conda create -n agentmove python==3.10
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Preprocessing
```bash
# Step1: you can define city collection in config.py with EXP_CITIES
EXP_CITIES = ["Shanghai"] # for WWW 2019 ISP
# EXP_CITIES = ['Tokyo', 'Nairobi', 'NewYork', 'Sydney', 'CapeTown', 'Paris', 'Beijing', 'Mumbai', 'SanFrancisco', 'London', 'SaoPaulo', 'Moscow'] # for TIST 2015

# download data tist2015(used in paper), www2019(used in paper), tsmc2014
# we have uploaded www2019 dataset in data folder
python -m processing.download --data_name=www2019

# Step2:
# # processing Foursquare data, tist2015, gowalla
# python -m processing.process_fsq_city_data

# processing IPS GPS trajectory data www2019
python -m processing.process_isp_shanghai

# Step3: get open street map address
# A local Nominatim service must be deployed prior to executing these commands. Alternatively, you may utilize the official Nominatim API
python -m processing.osm_address_deploy
# python -m processing.osm_address_web

# Step4: matching trajectory with address
python -m processing.trajectory_address_match

# DEBUGING Tips
1. If you encounter any exceptions, you can try relaxing the try-except control in the code to help with debugging.
2. You can refer to the launch.json in .vscode to debug with remote server.
